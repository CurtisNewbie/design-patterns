# Builder Design Pattern

"The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions. The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create."

In addition to facilitating object instantiation, it allows you to create immutable object with the aids of method chaining.
