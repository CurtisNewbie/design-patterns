## Patterns

### Creational Design Patterns

- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern

    - (it seems that Prototype Pattern is always referring to 'cloning' an object to improve performance, but implementing Cloneable doesn't seem to be a good idea based on Effective Java)

### Structural Design Patterns 

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

### Behaviour Design Patterns
